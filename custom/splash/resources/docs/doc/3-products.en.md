### Product Catalog Management

Splash has many features dedicated to the management of the product catlogue.

The management of stocks and sale prices are very sensitive points.
Take the time to fully understand what the different parameters are for in order to configure them correctly.

#### Warehouse used for stock movements

In order to properly manage your inventory, you must tell Splash which warehouse to use for inventory corrections.

<div class="callout-block callout-warning">
    <div class="icon-holder">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4 class="callout-title">Warning</h4>
        <p>At a minimum, you must create a warehouse, even if you only have one storage location.</p>
    </div>
</div>

#### Default warehouse for product configurations

When creating products, Splash can configure them so that they are associated with the warehouse of your choice.

#### Multi-Price: Default price used by the module

If you are using Dolibarr's multi-price feature, you must tell Splash which price level to use as the default price.

The other price levels will also be accessible, but in additional fields
that you will need to manually connect from your Splash account.

#### [Expert] Manage your Warehouse Stocks by Warehouse

**This function requires activation of the "Expert" mode**

If you work with several Warehouses, this mode will allow you to independently access the stocks of each warehouse.

A field will be created for each warehouse, it will then have to be configured on your Splash account.

<div class="callout-block callout-success">
    <div class="icon-holder">
        <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4 class="callout-title">Multi-site management</h4>
        <p>It is now possible to manage the stocks of your E-Commerce sites and your points of sale separately.</p>
    </div>
</div>
 
The actual stock of your products, generic fields and automatically connected, will now be read only.
You can read it, but not modify it.
